            <p2>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take in a bunch of different directions.
                JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node Server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p2>
            <ul>
                <li><p4>Variable Declaration</p4><p2>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - 
                    imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.</p2><p3>var x;</p3></li>
                <li><p4>Variable Assignments</p4><p2>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value ro a variable.<p3>var x = 10;</p3></p2></li>
                <li><p4>Data Type </p4><p2>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <p3> true </p3> or <p3> false; </p3> null - <p3> null </p3> aka nothing; Number - <p3> 42 </p3> or <p3> 3.14159;</p3> String - <p3> "Coding Dojo Rocks!";</p3> Array - <p3> [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</p3>and Object - <p3> {first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</p3></p2></li>
                <li><p4>Conditionals </p4><p2> When you write code, you want to perform different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <p3>if</p3> a specified condition is true, do this code in our block; <p3> else if </p3> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <p3> else </p3> we execute this block of code; </p2></li>
                <li><p4>Loops </p4><p2> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat and action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</p2></li>
                <li><p4>Functions </p4><p2> Functions are a encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual abd get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again. </p2></li>
